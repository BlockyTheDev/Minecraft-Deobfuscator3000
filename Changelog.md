* Fixing a bug when replaced files being messed up!
* Fixing a bug when console was not cleared when ctrl + middle click was issued!
* Console now allows for horizontal scrolling when window is too small!
* Application is now wrapped into setup installer together with java runtime, effectively eliminating necessity of you having java on your device!
* Procyon decompiler is now implemented together with deobfuscator so Deobfuscator3000 is now effectively java decompiler as well while eliminating necessity of you having your mods predecompiled before deobfuscating!
* Small bugs fixed!
* Note: Implementation of decompiler is not the best one yet because it cant properly deal with inner and nested classes and its performance is questionable as well!
